Code Explanation
==================

Overall Explanation
--------------------

- With our follow along examples, we were able to move our robot arm with precision as well as produce music with our integrated speaker within the zetabot.

- The instructional codes have been compile into a jupyter notebook for the ease of use. 

- This section will explain the libraries used for the *follow along* section. 


Sound
-------------------------------

.. thumbnail:: /_images/Day1/3.arm_dance/dance.png

- For our dancing robot demonstration, we published an array of integer to ROS Topic called ``/play_specific``. 

.. code-block:: python
    os.system('rostopic pub -1 /play_specific std_msgs/String "data: \'/root/scripts/sensor/arm_sounds/music_1.mp3\'"')

- The ``play_specific`` topic publishes messages to the play_sound node. You can play a sound file by entering the absolute path of the sound file.

.. code-block:: python
    os.system('rostopic pub -1 /play_specific std_msgs/String "data: \'stop\'"')

- Or you can stop the currently playing music with the stop command.

.. code-block:: python
    !ls /root/scripts/sensor/arm_sounds

- The list of music files that can be played can be checked with the following command.
