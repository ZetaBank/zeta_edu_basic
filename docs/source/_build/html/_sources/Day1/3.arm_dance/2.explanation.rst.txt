Overall Explanation
--------------------

-   With our follow along examples, we were able to move our robot arm with precision as well. 

-   The instructional codes have been compile into a jupyter notebook for the ease of use. 

Main process
--------------------

- The main function built for our main process is camera function. Within the function:

    1. Initialize the camera input, and the framerate. 

        .. code-block:: python

            # Open camera
            capture = cv.VideoCapture(1)
            
    2. Capture every frame from the camera on loop.

        .. code-block:: python
            
            while True:
               
        1. Import in the frame of the input feed and resize it to 640, 480 ratio. 

            .. code-block:: python

                _, img = capture.read()

                img = cv.resize(img, (640, 480))

        
        2. If the model is set to exit, close all the windows opened and release the camera.

            .. code-block:: python 

                if model == 'Exit':
                    cv.destroyAllWindows()
                    capture.release()
                    break
    
    3. To activate the function above, first activate a display output, then within a thread run the function.

        .. code-block:: python

            display(controls_box,output)
            threading.Thread(target=camera, ).start()
